You look around to see your parents huddled around a fire in a corner and approach them. They tell you that Japan has finally released their Gundam fighters and taken over the world, but have ravaged your country making this underground subway tunnel the only safe area left in your town. Suddenly a wave of shock and dismay come over you as you realize your beloved Anime Girl Body Pillow has been forgotten at home, as a true Otaku your only option is to venture out into the wilderness to save your waifu. You bid your parents goodbye, and with an awkward look on their face they hug you. Luckily you are armed with your adamant belief that you are trained in Ninjitsu and Saiyain fighting styles which give you absolutely no abilities at all."
